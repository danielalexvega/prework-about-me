      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Vega. I'm a high school math and
        computer science teacher. I have taught for 7 years, and I currently
        teach at McCallum High School, which is the fine arts magnet
        for Austin ISD. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Houston, Texas. I moved to San Marcos in 2005
        to attend Texas State University, where I majored in Sound Recording
        Technology. 

        I moved to Austin in 2011, and started teaching in 2013 at the Alternative
        Learning Center, which is the Discipline High School. I taught there for 
        the first four years of my career, before moving to McCallum. 
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobby is making music. I've been in several bands since college,
        and have put out four records and three EPs, give or take. I play the drums,
        guitar, bass, keyboards, and sing. I enjoy all genres, and really love focusing
        on the problem-solving aspect of music writing. Every riff or chord progression 
        is a riddle waiting to be solved, and I can't stop thinking about it 
        until I've recorded the song. 

        The bands I've been in are Zlam Dunk, Tactics, Desert Culture, Crooked Numbers, and 
        a few others. We've played shows all around Austin and Texas, including Houston, Dallas,
        and San Antonio. I've also been on a few tours, playing Chicago, New York City,
        Boston, Philidelphia, Washington D.C, and most cities on the East Coast. 

        You can listen to my latest record by 
        <a href="https://www.crookednumbers.bandcamp.com/">Crooked Numbers</a> here. 

        My other favorite hobby is watching and playing sports. I love the NBA, and I love playing
        ultimate frisbee. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure what my dream job would be; I think every job has it's pros and cons.
        I would love to make music full time, but then I might have to make music with the goal
        of making money, and I prefer to just write whatever I want without the need to sell anything.

        I loved being a teacher; it's just a sad reality that they're not paid what they're worth.

        My dream job then would be somewhere that I can learn and solve problems. I think I will find that
        in a backend developer role, although I'm sure I'll have a better idea after I finish this bootcamp. 

      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the Mueller neighbor hood, on the East side of Austin, about 3 miles from 
        the University of Texas. 
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I taught Math and AP Computer Science, and I love the problem solving nature of both subjects.
        I believe I can get that satisfaction as a developer.
